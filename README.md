### Integrated Cultures

- Merge cultures with same discrimination traits
	- Optionally merge cultures with almost the same discrimination traits
	- Significantly boost the performance
	- No or little gameplay effect
- Dynamically change culture names after merging
	- i.e. `North German` will become `German` if `South German` is merged into it (which happens after Germany is formed)
- Dynamic culture homeland depending on local pop culture fraction
	- Faster incorporation speed for colonies
- Compatiable with most other mods
	- Those with additional cultures are still compatiable, but additional cultures won't be merged (the dynamical homeland change will work fine)
